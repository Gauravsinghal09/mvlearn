# Implements Multi view Co training Regression for 2 view data


class CTRegressor(BaseCoTrainEstimator):
    r"""
    This class implements the co-training regression for supervised
    and semisupervised learning with the framework as described in [#1CTR].
    The best use case is when nthe 2 views of input data are sufficiently
    distinct and independent as detailed in [#1CTR]. However this can also
    be successfull when na single matrix of input data is given as
    both views and two estimators are choosen
    which are quite different.[#2CTR]

    In the semi-supervised case, performance can vary greatly, so using
    a separate validation set or cross validation procedure is
    recommended to ensure the regression model has fit well.

    Parameters

    estimator1: sklearn object, (currently only supports K Nearest Neighbour)
        The regressor object which will be trained on view1 of the data.

        The regressir object which will be trained on view2 of the data.

    neighbors_size: int, optional (default = 5)

        squared error.

    n_iter: int, optional (default = 100)

    selected_size: int, optional (default = 5)
        The maximum number of samples to be selected from the
        pool of unlabelled samples

    random_state: int (defalut = None)
        The seed for fit() method and other class operations

    Notes
    -----
    Multi-view co-training is most helpful for tasks in semi-supervised
    learning where each view offers unique information not seen in the
    other. As is shown in the example notebooks for using this algorithm,
    multi-view co-training can provide good regression results even
    when number of unlabeled samples far exceeds the number of labeled
    samples. This regressor uses 2 slearn regressors which work individually
    on each view but which share information and thus result in improved
    performance over looking at the views completely separately.
    The regressor needs to be KNearestRegressor, as described in the [#1CTR].

    Algorithm
    ---------
    Given:

        * a set *L1*, *L2* having labeled training
        samples of each view respectively

        * a set *U* of unlabeled samples (with 2 views)

    Create a pool *U'* of examples at random from *U*

        * Use *L1* to train a regressor *h1* (``estimator1``) that considers
          only the view 1 portion of the data (i.e. Xs[0])
        * Use *L2* to train a regressor *h2* (``estimator2``) that considers
          only the view 2 portion of the data (i.e. Xs[1])

        Loop for *T* iterations
            * for each viewj
                * for each *u* in *U'*
                    * Predict the value *y_hat* of *u* by *hj*
                    * Calculate the *k* nearest neighbour of *u*
                    (lets call the list of neighbours as *omega*)
                    * Train a new regressor model *hj'* with same parameters
                    as *hj* on the *Lj* union *u* with label as *y_hat*
                    * for i in *omega*
                        * Calculate the predicted value of i and take the
                        differene between initial predicted value from *hj*
                        and final predicted value from  new *hj'* for each i
                        * Add the calculated value to a list named as *delta*
                * sort the list in descending order of values and select
                those indexes whose difference turned out to be positive
                * let the list of indexes selected be *pi_j*
                * remove the selected indexes from *U'* and replenish it
            * Add the selected index *pi_1* to the other
            regressor training example i.e. *L2*
            * Add the selected index *pi_2* to the other
            regressor training example i.e. *L1*
            * Use *L1* to train the regressor *h1*
            * Use *L2* to train the regressor *h2*
