def mv_data_split(Xs, test_size=None, train_size=None,
                  random_state=None, shuffle=True, stratify=None):
    r'''
    Splits multi-view data into random train and test subsets. This
    utility wraps the train_test_split function from
    sklearn.model_selection for ease of use.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Xs : list of array-likes or numpy.ndarray
        - Xs length: n_views
        - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i) or (n_samples,)
        The multiple views of data.

    test_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of test samples. If None,
        the value is set to the complement of the train size. If
        train_size is also None, it will be set to 0.25.

    train_size: float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test
        size.

    random_state: int or RandomState instance, default=None
        Controls the shuffling applied to the data before applying the
        split. Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple
        function calls.

    shuffle: bool, default=True
        Whether or not to shuffle the data before splitting. If
        shuffle=False then stratify must be None.

    stratify: array-like, default=None
        If not None, data is split in a stratified fashion, using
        this as the class labels.

    Returns
    -------
    Xs_train : list of array-likes
        - Xs length: n_views
        - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)
        The subset of the data for training.

    Xs_test : list of array-likes
        - Xs length: n_views
        - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)
        The subset of the data for testing.
